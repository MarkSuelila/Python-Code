# Python-Code
# From Raw Excel to Insightful Visualization in Python

Today, I explored a simple yet powerful data analysis workflow using Pandas and Matplotlib to extract meaningful insights from an Excel dataset.

# Here's what I did:

✅ Loaded raw Excel data containing Country, Year, and Revenue fields using pandas.read_excel()
✅ Filtered key columns and created a pivot table to organize revenue data per country over multiple years
✅ Calculated a Grand Total column to summarize each country's total revenue across all years
✅ Formatted all numeric values with thousands separators (e.g., 1,000,000) for better readability
✅ Visualized the trends using a line chart, helping to clearly compare how revenue evolved by country over
